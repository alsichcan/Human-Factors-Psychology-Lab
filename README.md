Personal Research   
> From Bimodal to Multimodal:Augmented MELD for Emotion Recognition in Conversations

🌐 augmentd_MELD_preprocessing.ipynb  
🔸This notebook preprocesses the MELD dataset, organizing and classifying image data based on emotion labels.

🌐 augmentd_MELD_processing.ipynb  
🔸The script processes video and label data from the MELD dataset and utilizes the face_recognition library to identify main characters' faces from the "Friends" series. The process involves face detection, data labeling, and face recognition.

🌐 augmentd_MELD_landmark.py  
🔸The script uses the face_recognition library to detect facial landmarks in an image, then draws and saves the image with those landmarks highlighted.
